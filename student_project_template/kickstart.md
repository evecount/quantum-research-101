# 🚀 Stage 2: The Quantum Kickstart

**Congratulations, Founder.**

You have completed the `start-here-quantum-lab.ipynb`.
You have:
✅ Generated Entanglement (The Product).
✅ Selected a Mission (The Market).
✅ Modeled the Features (The Intelligence).

Now, it is time to leave the "Lab" and enter the **"Factory"**.

## 🏗️ Your Next Objective: Build the API

Investors don't buy Notebooks. They buy **Systems**.
You will now convert your prototype into a living **Web Application**.

### Step 1: The Architecture

We are moving from "Cell-by-Cell" execution to a **FastAPI Microservice**.

* **Endpoint 1:** `/generate_key` -> Trigger Qiskit, Return Entangled ID.
* **Endpoint 2:** `/verify_transaction` -> Check Feature Vector against Neural Net.

### Step 2: The Setup

1. Navigate to the `student_project_template` folder.
2. Initialize a new Python project: `npm init` or `python -m venv venv`.
3. Install the production dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).

### Step 3: The Challenge

Your goal is to build a **"Proof of Concept" (PoC)** Dashboard.

* **The User:** Scans a QR Code (The Quantum Tag).
* **The System:** Shows "✅ VERIFIED BY PHYSICS" or "❌ TAMPER DETECTED".

**Good luck. The Quantum Realm awaits.**
