# MASTER PROMPT: Quantum Research Project Design

## Project Goal
Design a Firebase-backed application to support a quantum research project. Your application should be capable of:
1.  **Estimating fill probability** for quantum states.
2.  Storing and analyzing **data from statistical learning algorithms** applied to quantum experiments.
3.  Potentially integrating with **quantum-transformed data** for novel insights.

## Task: Firebase Database Design
Based on an abstract of a relevant quantum computing paper (which you will select), propose a detailed Firebase database structure. Your design should specifically address how you would:

### 1. Data Modeling with Smart Schemas
*   **Represent quantum experimental data**: Consider inputs (e.g., gate sequences, qubit states), outputs (e.g., measurement results, probabilities), and metadata (e.g., experiment date, researcher, hardware used).
*   **Implement Smart Schemas**: Utilize Firebase's capabilities to model relationships between different data entities. Think about:
    *   **Junction Tables (Collections)**: How would you link many-to-many relationships, such as experiments to multiple quantum states, or users to multiple projects?
    *   **Foreign Keys (References)**: How would you establish one-to-many or one-to-one relationships, such as an experiment referencing a specific quantum device configuration or a user's profile?

### 2. Supporting Fill Probability Estimation
*   Design a schema that can store parameters and results necessary for calculating and tracking 'fill probability' (or any similar derived metric relevant to your chosen paper's abstract). How would you structure this data to enable efficient computation or retrieval of these estimations?

### 3. Incorporating Statistical Learning Data
*   Propose how your Firebase structure would accommodate data generated by statistical learning algorithms. This might include:
    *   Model parameters (e.g., weights, biases).
    *   Training data used for models.
    *   Model predictions or classifications.
    *   Evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss, precision, recall).

### 4. Integration with Quantum-Transformed Data
*   Consider how your database could store or link to data that has undergone quantum transformations (e.g., data processed by quantum algorithms, feature mapped into quantum states). While Firebase itself is classical, think about how it can serve as a repository for results derived from quantum processes.

### 5. Creative Freedom in Trading Algorithm Design (Optional Extension)
*   If applicable to your chosen paper's context, creatively integrate how your Firebase schema could support a hypothetical trading algorithm. This could involve storing historical quantum data, market indicators influenced by quantum effects, or algorithm performance metrics. Focus on the data structure, not the algorithm itself.

## Deliverables
*   A markdown file (`MASTER-PROMPT.md`) outlining your proposed Firebase database schema (collections, documents, fields) with explanations for each section based on your selected paper's abstract.
*   Briefly describe the abstract of the quantum computing paper you chose to base your design on.
