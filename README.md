# 🚀 The Universal Quantum Laboratory: The AI Co-Founder Model

**Welcome to the future of Startup Incubation.**

This repository is **not** just a coding tutorial. It is a **Business & Physics Sandbox** designed to take you from "Student" to "Founder" in 2 hours.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

We believe that **Quantum Mechanics** is too important to be left only to physicists.
Real-world adoption requires **Business Utility**.

In this workshop, you pair with an **AI Co-Founder** (LLM of your choice) to build:

1. **The Product:** A "Digital Tamper Seal" using Quantum Entanglement.
2. **The Business:** A scalable "Entanglement as a Service" (EaaS) API.
3. **The Proof:** A reproducible scientific notebook backed by Git.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

* **Physics:** IBM Qiskit (Superconducting Qubits)
* **Intelligence:** Neural Network Feature Engineering (Python)
* **Database:** Google Firebase (NoSQL)
* **Control:** Git (Methodology as Code)

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `start-here-quantum-lab.ipynb`: **Start Here!** This is your MVP Prototype. A guided Jupyter Notebook that builds the Core Engine.
* `student_project_template/`: Contains the `kickstart.md` guide for **Stage 2** (Building the full application).
* `src/`: Reference code for the production backend.

## 🎓 Authorship

Created by **Eve Count Pte Ltd** & **Antigravity**.

* **Vision:** Gwendalynn
* **Architecture:** Antigravity (Google DeepMind)
