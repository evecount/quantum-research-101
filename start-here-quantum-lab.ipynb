                "-   **Pros:** Maximum Security. Mathematically unbreakable.\n",
                "-   **Cons:** **Slow.** Requires a new circuit run for every single user event.\n",
                "-   **Best For:** Mission 1 (Quantum Vault) & 3 (TruthStamp - High Value Contracts).\n",
                "-   **Required Gates:** `Hadamard`, `CNOT`.\n",
                "\n",
                "### ⏱️ Option B: The \"Chronos Chain\" (1:Many Time-Binning)\n",
                "-   **Mechanism:** A continuous stream of entanglement is generated (like a heartbeat). Users are verified by **when** they interact with the stream (to the nanosecond).\n",
                "-   **Pros:** **Massive Scale.** One quantum source can secure millions of transactions per second.\n",
                "-   **Cons:** Requires extreme **Time Synchronization** hardware.\n",
                "-   **Best For:** Mission 2 (TrueID / HFT) & 5 (EcoTrack).\n",
                "-   **Required Gates:** `Phase Gates (P)`, `Rotation (RY)` for time encoding.\n",
                "\n",
                "### 🕸️ Option C: The \"Spider Web\" (Many:Many GHZ State)\n",
                "-   **Mechanism:** Entangling 3 or more parties (e.g., Buyer, Seller, Regulator) into a single state. All must agree to collapse the function.\n",
                "-   **Pros:** **Consensus.** Impossible for one party to cheat the others.\n",
                "-   **Cons:** **Fragile.** The state collapses easily (Decoherence) as you add more particles.\n",
